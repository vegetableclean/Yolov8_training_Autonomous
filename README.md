# YOLOv8 Training with Qcars

This repository contains code and resources for training **YOLOv8** (You Only Look Once version 8) on **Qcars** datasets. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how to leverage YOLOv8 for object detection tasks, specifically tailored for identifying objects in Qcars2 datasets.

## Overview

**YOLOv8** is the latest version of the YOLO family of object detection models. This repository focuses on using YOLOv8 to train on datasets related to **Qcars**. By utilizing the power of YOLOv8, the model can be trained to detect various objects with high accuracy and speed.

## Key Features

- **YOLOv8 Implementation:** All necessary code and configurations to train YOLOv8 on the Qcars dataset.
- **Qcars Dataset Integration:** Instructions on how to download and prepare the Qcars dataset for YOLOv8 training.
- **Custom Training Pipeline:** End-to-end pipeline for training, evaluating, and testing the YOLOv8 model on your specific Qcars data.
- **Pre-trained Models:** Pre-trained weights for faster transfer learning or to start from a baseline.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Tools for evaluating model performance using standard object detection metrics.
